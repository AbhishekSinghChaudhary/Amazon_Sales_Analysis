# Amazon_Sales_Analysis
PYTHON PROJECT
Project Objective: 

The objective of the project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Amazon sales data using Python. This includes downloading the data from Kaggle in CSV format, loading it into a Jupyter Notebook, and cleaning the data. Using various Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the project aims to analyze the data to uncover insights such as popular items based on sales, trends in sales across different categories, and identifying regions or states with higher purchasing activities. Overall, the goal is to derive actionable insights from the data to inform decision-making and optimize sales strategies on Amazon.

Dataset: Sales Dataset

Steps:

Download Dataset: Obtain the Diwali sales dataset from GitHub in CSV format.

Setup Environment: Set up your Python environment with necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. You can use tools like Anaconda to manage your environment efficiently.

Load Data: Import the dataset into your Jupyter Notebook using Pandas read_csv() function.

Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explore the structure of the dataset (columns, rows).
Check for any anomalies or outliers.
Visualize basic statistics of the dataset.
Plot distributions of numerical variables.
Explore relationships between variables using correlation analysis.
Data Visualization:

Create visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain insights into the data.
Plot sales trends over time.
Visualize the distribution of sales across different product categories.
Compare sales performance between different genders.
Explore any other relevant factors such as sales by region, age group, etc.
Data Analysis:

Calculate key metrics such as total sales, average sales per customer, etc.
Analyze sales patterns during the Diwali period.
Identify top-selling products or categories.
Compare sales performance between male and female customers.
Investigate any significant trends or patterns discovered during EDA.
Insights and Recommendations:

Summarize the key findings from the analysis.
Provide insights into factors influencing Diwali sales.
Make recommendations for optimizing sales strategies based on the analysis.
Suggest potential areas for further investigation or improvement.
Documentation and Reporting:

Document your code and analysis process for future reference.
Create a report or presentation summarizing the project objectives, methodology, findings, and recommendations.
Present your findings to stakeholders or colleagues as needed.
Iterate and Improve: Reflect on the project process and outcomes, and consider any areas for improvement or further analysis. Iterate on your analysis based on feedback or new insights gained during the project.
